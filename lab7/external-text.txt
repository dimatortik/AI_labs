I waited 40 minutes for my order and it arrived cold; the staff was rude when I asked for help.
Great atmosphere and friendly employees; everything was clean and the food tasted fresh.
The product stopped working after two days and customer support never replied to my emails.
Fast delivery, good packaging, and the quality is better than expected for this price.
It was acceptable but nothing special; I probably would not go out of my way to return.
