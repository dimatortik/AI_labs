if you like quantity over quality this is the place for you the food is mediocre at best i ordered the 2 eggs hashbrowns with a side of pancakes it was a lot of food for only 5 but the large portions with cheap prices is the only thing they have going for them my bf got the chicken fried steak which he could not finish becuase it was too fatty we were really looking forward to the biscuits and gravy after reading the reviews however we were very disappointed as they completely lacked any flavor n nif you are looking for good quality food skip this place,0.00028273943,0,0
we have great luck every time we come to this store the cast members are super friendly and helpful don t mind when my toddler throws a fit because she wants everything and its all mine mine mine they also allow me to hand them things she has collected throughout the store and whisper we aren t getting this and they just smile and laugh hard to find people who are so wonderful in retail nowadays they might be better than the employees at the fashion show nalso i ve never had a problem with the merch being crap as stated in other reviews it is different stuff than what you ll find in a regular disney store but what do you expect it s an outlet that is true for all outlet stores even gap banana republic polo etc,0.86402625,1,1

this is a cool somewhat novelty addition to the usual unlv eatery rounds chiptole cafe rio cugino s etc when i forget to pack my lunch lol this place is especially helpful for vegetarian options and i ve had the rice bowl with tofu in jamaican jerk twice now and though it tasted more like teriyaki sauce and was not the least bit spicy i still thought it was reasonably good another plus is that they have brown rice too n nalso as of late the staff been so generous with their 3 off coupons the first time i came they gave me two n nthe only downside was that i felt like there was just so much rice compared to protein and veggies which somehow made the filipino in me feel just a teensy bit gypped nevertheless i will probably be back and see how other options on their menu fare,0.9572589,1,1
eh i wanted to find a place where i could get a couple of cheap tacos and a beer so i gave it shot with the family it wasn t bad just nothing special i would give it 2 1 2 stars if that was an option n nthe food is okay i had an al pastor taco and a carne asada taco and i tried a few bites of my wife s chicken burrito it was all just okay can t say anything bad but not really anything good to say either i d honestly rather hit taco bell and i can think of 10 mexican restaurants taco shops in vegas i would rather go to n nthe staff was friendly but a little unorganized we were one of 3 other parties in the place and it kind of took awhile to get the food maybe the staff was new or something n ni get the whole graffiti thing and trying an alternative casual look but it s a little over the top sharpie marker written all over the walls rails seats and everything else that seems to be written mostly by teenagers wanting to be hard core by dropping an f bomb via permanent marker whatever n nif i happened to be in that shopping center and felt like a taco or burrito i might try it again but not going out of the way to go back,0.0029306083,0,0
i went with my young son last night to check out the new menu and i loved it i ordered the chickpea curry over brown rice spicy it was absolutely delicious and is alone a good reason to return we also ordered the lentil patty appetizer which was good although not my favorite they serve a masala black iced tea which was unusual and delicious my son ordered from the kids meal a backup just in case and he chose baked chicken fingers which came with a side of fruit cocktail and a full sized drink overall the food was a modern healthy version of my favorites with courteous and attentive customer service in a beautifully decorated space n nfour stars because i want to try more of their menu make sure service and quality stay consistent and because they were inexplicably playing a steve miller band greatest hits album during our visit n ni want to fly like an eagle to the sea,0.9992167,1,1
i was really excited to try out lo lo s because i had heard a lot of good things about it but i was not very impressed nwe went on a sunday afternoon and it was very crowded which i normally don t mind if the food service is amazing had to wait 45 min to be seated ni ordered the lil c two drumsticks with a side of mac and cheese and a side of string beans and potatoes the food was not what i would call very good chicken was pretty dry and very salty my string beans were never brought out and i had to ask for them twice the service was pretty poor i won t be returning,0.00011788536,0,0

i came here some time ago for dinner with my husband i had wanted to try todd s for some time checking out their website and drooling over the video demos they have ni must say that the dining room looks kind of dated and the booth where we sat was not very comfortable but i was encouraged to see that everybody seemed to be having a great time so i relaxed n nwe started off with the goat cheese wonton which was super good then i chose skirt steak for my entr u00e9e and the hubby chose the short rib both were fantastic the skirt steak is frickin awesome they serve it with chili cheese fries holy cow this dish is hearty hearty we both ordered cocktails cannot recall which ones and neither of us liked them i would say be safe and choose beer or wine anyway who orders chili cheese fries steak and a cocktail get a beer dammit n nwhat i found particularly thoughtful is that chef clore came out an stopped at every table throughout the evening to check and see how their meal was including ours it s that fantastic service that will keep people coming back to the restaurant,0.996154,1,1

i have been to this kneaders location no less than 20 times since they first opened each time i said it was time to write a yelp review but once i got home i tried to overlook the poor unfriendly service that i received today is the day i write a review n nlet me start by saying i always go through the drive thru 95 of the time the service has been less than friendly and many times i felt that i was putting the employee out by even using the drive thru i have waited as long as 22 minutes in the drive thru 4 cars ahead of me only to be greeted at the window with 16 34 no sorry for the long wait no thank you for your patience nothing on numerous occasions the bag was handed to me here you go and the window was shut on my face i found i was the only saying thank you i ve come to the conclusion they place their most unfriendly and rude employees at the drive thru window i don t take it out on the employee because obviously they have not been trained properly in customer service n ntoday around 11 30 am my son went to kneaders to pick up lunch i have posted a picture of how they packed the bag 1 full sized sandwich an order of french toast and an order of bread pudding they were not placed in 2 bags or flat in the bag but they crammed all of it in one bag on their sides the inside of the sandwich slide out of the bread and was loose in the plastic container the bread pudding and french toast well you can imagine how those looked this is what prompted me to finally write a review n ni watched this location being built and on the first day it opened i went through the drive thru and spoke to a trainer who was here from utah i told him how much i was looking forward to the restaurant opening and that ahwatukee needed a place like kneaders n n ahwatukee is a small community within a large city word of mouth goes a long way in this area management needs to start reading the yelp reviews respond and make changes accordingly my next trip to kneaders will be to return my loyalty card,0.0009738536,0,0
